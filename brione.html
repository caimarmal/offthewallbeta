            <h3>Welcome to Brione, Switzerland!</h3>
            <p>Brione is one of many beautiful climbing areas in Switzerland, and in particular the south area that borders Italy. These valleys are know for their sweeping elevation gains, and beautiful view. Verzasca Valley, where Brione is found, is fully of small towns along a beauitful winding road. Many of the recommendation you will find here will be in the surrounding areas outside of that particular valley where there are some bigger towns.</p>

                <h3>Castello di Montebello</h3>
                <p>Castello is the Italian word for Castle, and if you are interested in architecture of the past then this will be a great rest day site to visit. This castle is located nearby in Bellinzona. Visiting this site offers beautiful views from where it is perched, as well as keeps you active. With it's grand size you will have to walk quite a bit to see it all. It will certainly feel like a blast from the past to spend your day walking through and around such a beautiful piece of history! You can learn more about this castle at this <a href="https://www.ticino.ch/en/commons/details/The-Castle-of-Montebello/2796.html" target="_blank">Ticino Tourism Website.</a></p>

                <p>If you love plants as much as I do, then you'll find yourself having a pleasant rest day at the Gambarogno Botanical Park. Due to the terrain of the area you'll also find may beautiful vistas while visiting the park. Like any botanical garden you could enjoy the beauty for a quick visit or for a few hours. Like my previous recommendation this site will offer an opportunity to be outside and active on a rest day. You can learn more about these gardens at this <a href="https://www.ticino.ch/en/commons/details/Botanical-garden-of-Gambarogno/85680.html" target="_blank">Ticino Tourism Website.</a></p>

                <h3>Verzasca Dam</h3>
                <p>The Verzasca Dam is a towering piece of infrastructure that holds back the beautiful waters that you will have the chance to see all throughout the Verzasca Valley. Walking out onto the dam isn't for the faint of heart. I'm speaking from personal experience here, as although I like bouldering, there are some heights that feel a little different. As you walk out onto the dam be sure to look over the edge, if you desire, as you may be treated to small birds swooping about, and enjoying the updrafts created by the massive structure. They even offer bungee jumping off of the dam, if you're looking for something even more exciting to spice up your rest day. Learn more about this dam, as well as the bungee jumping opportunities, at <a href="https://www.ascona-locarno.com/en/what-s-on/stories/jump-into-the-green-heart-of-ticino" target="_blank">Ascona Locarno.</a></p>

                <p>You can be hard pressed to find one of my favorite foods in many places throughout the US, but delicious kebab can be found throughout Europe. Jian Kebab offers a traditional and delicious kebab experience, with kind and excellent service. Everyone likes something a bit different when going for Kebab, but my personal favorite is Doner with extra spicy sauce; so tasty! Jian Kebab doesn't have a website yet so you'll have to search it up to go and visit.</p>

                <h3>Ristorante Pizzeria Centrale Minusio</h3>
                <p>This small local spot offers some wonderful and classic Italian cuisine options. After visiting twice, although their pizza is good, I found that their pastas, and especially their lasagna were some of the best items on the menu. Their menu is quite extensive, so it may take a moment to find what you are looking for, but it does offer something for everyone, while still staying focused on the classics. As a bonus their desserts, in particular the tiramisu, are quite yummy as well. You won't find a website for this restaurant, so you'll have to give it a search to check it out.</p>

                <h3>Laderach Chocolatier</h3>
                <p>Well, I guess this one might not be food in the meal sense, but I feel like I could make a meal out of the chocolates from Laderach. This high quality Chocolatier offers all the delicious chocolate treats your heart could desire. Their flavors range from classic to inventive and interesting, and you'll certainly want to make a trip back for more, so plan on visiting early on during you stay. One of their specialties appears to be a style of chocolate bark filled with different flavors and ingredients that melt in your mouth. To get your mouth watering visit the <a href="https://laderach.com/us-en/" target="_blank">Laderach Website</a>, which even ships to the US!</p>

Just in case you loose a shoe, or forgot to bring your chalk bag. If you're in need, Belotti Sport will have just about everything you are looking for. Much of their climbing equipment and apparel will be found on their upstairs level. While they have other general apparel downstairs. This could be helpful if you need some lighter or heavier layers depending on what the weather has decided to do. To preview a little more of what they offer visit the <a href="https://belottisport.ch/" target="_blank">Belotti Sport Website.</a></p>

                <h3>Walkable Shops from the Train Station</h3>
                <p>There are many places you can stay that offer close access to the Verzasca Valley. Locarno is defintely a beautiful place to stay nearby. In my experience, if you are looking to meander around town and see what there is to find for shopping and food, the train station is a great place to start off from. You'll find yourself immediately close to lots of shops, and the water front. As you begin to walk about you will find yourself weaving through alley ways finding different shops and restaurants as you go. I enjoy these jumping off points to explore, as you'll never know what neat places you might find. There isn't a website for this shopping destination; you'll just search up the Locarno Train Station.</p>
