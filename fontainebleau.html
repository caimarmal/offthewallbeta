            <h3>Welcome to Fontainebleau, France</h3>
            <p>Fontainebleau, lovingly known as Font, is a seemingly never ending enchanted forest of boulders. These boulders span quite a bit further than their namesake city, and are a beautiful site to behold. Just as there are a multitude of boulders in this area, there are many places to explore and spend quality time. I surely won't scratch even the surface, but I'm happy to share my own recommendations and experiences here.</p>

                <h3 class="dropdown-site1">Chateau de Fontainebleau</h3>
                <p class="show-site1">Chateau can be translated to castle in English. And the Chateau de Fontainebleau is definitely one of the most beautifully kept and grand castles that I've had the opportunity to visit. It truly feels like you are able to step back in time all thanks to the conservation efforts of the people who take care of this beautiful palace and gardens. If you are looking for a great activity on a rainy day, a walk through the palace is just the place to go. You could even save your walk through the gardens for another day entirely when the weather is more pleasant. I highly recommend visiting the <a href="https://www.chateaudefontainebleau.fr/en/" target="_blank">Chateau de Fontainebleau website</a> to learn more about this beautiful and historic place.</p>

                <h3 class="dropdown-site2">Train to Paris</h3>
                <p class="show-site2">You'd be surprised how easy it is to pop over to Paris for the day when you're staying in Font. A train ride from Font to Paris only takes a quick 45 mins, and then you can walk around and see the sites of Paris to your hearts content. The public transportation system throughout France is, in my own experience, easy and fun. Taking the train helps you avoid the headaches of parking in the big city, and encourages a fun day of discovering a beautiful city by foot. My recommendation here is just to get off the beaten path. You can always start on the big main streets, but when you see little walking alleys here and there, dive in and make some new discoveries of delicious coffee shops or cute boutiques.</p>

                <h3 class="dropdown-site3">Drive to Loire Valley</h3>
                <p class="show-site3">The French countryside is absolutely beautiful, and a rest day drive with some good music is a great way to soak in those views. One of the places we drove to was the Loire Valley, which is very well know for their wine. We specifically decided to visit the village of Sancerre. Once we entered town we drove until we found a spot we liked and went in for a wine tasting. The wine was the very best I've ever had, and the gentleman who helped us with the tasting was beyond kind and generous. I don't think you can go wrong with a wine tasting in this lovely town.</p>

                <li>A great rest day activity can be taking a hike around these beautiful forests. And who knows, you'll probably find some boulders you'll be excited to visit on another day!</li>
                <li>Walking around towns can be lovely too. The architecture in a lot of these towns is a site to see in itself.</li>

                <h3 class="dropdown-food1">Paul & Paulette</h3>
                <p class="show-food1">Paul & Paulette is just the best little coffee shop and cafe in Fontainebleau. They serve delicious coffee and have different treats and lunch specials all the time, depending on what they are feeling for cooking that day. I can't remember ever ordering something I didn't enjoy. This is a must stop and enjoy on your rest days if you'll be staying around the Fontainebleau city. Their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/502080812/" target="_blank">Instagram Page</a> is worth a visit to see some good photos of what they are creating.</p>

                <h3 class="dropdown-food2">Le Glasgow</h3>
                <p class="show-food2">We stopped here one evening before heading out to dinner. This feels like a such a quintessential pub and offered up some great classic beers on tap and bottle. The atmosphere was very casual and busy. Some football matches were playing as we gathered around a make shift barrel table. The time flew by and then it was already time to head out for dinner. They don't have a website, but you can find out more about them on their <a href="https://fr-fr.facebook.com/@Glasgowfontainebleau/" target="_blank">Facebook Page.</a></p>

                <h3 class="dropdown-food3">La Petite Ardoise</h3>
                <p class="show-food3">La Petite Ardoise was a perfect French dinner. The menu is simple with just a few options for your small dish, main course, and dessert. The food feels rich, home-y, and delicous. The atmosphere is cosy and relaxed, with a great pacing so you can enjoy your meal with your friends and family. Visit the <a href="https://www.restaurantlapetiteardoise.fr/" target="_blank">La Petite Ardoise website</a> to see some pictures and take a peek at their menu.</p>

                <p class="show-shopping1">S'cape is the local climbing and outdoors shop in Fontainebleau. They have everything you could possibly want or need for bouldering, and the staff that works there is very helpful and kind. We would often find ourselves there on rest days picking up some tape or a new brush and saying hello. Check out the <a href="https://www.scape-shop.com/" target="_blank">S'cape website</a> to see more of what they have.</p>

                <p class="show-shopping2">The main downtown square of Milly-la-Foret often has a market with fresh foods, and surrounding that market are wonderful shops. This stop makes for a great rest day to grab some treats at the Boulangerie and Fromagerie, as well as walk about the different shops near the city center. Sometimes they even have art markets in the market hall in the center of town, which can be fun to browse the creations.</p>

                <p class="show-shopping3">In the main downtown area of Fontainebleau, near the Monoprix, you can find lots of shopping. The main street of Rue Grande, as well as Rue des Sablons just a few streets up have lots of shops to discover. It's great to take a walk about and see where you might want to stop for lunch another day or maybe you'll find just the shop you needed, who knows!</p>
