                <h2>What's the Beta?</h2>
                <p>Hello climber! My name is Caitlin, and I created Off the Wall Beta, because I love a good climbing trip. I also know that whether you are going near or far for that trip, or whether you are staying for a short or long while, that climbing is usually just one part of that adventure. Some of my favorite experiences have been the side adventures on those trips. This site is just for climbers who want to find fun food, sites, or shopping nearby their climbing destination. All these recommendations come from my own experiences, but as this site grows, I hope that other climbers can submit their own favorite spots to be added. As travelers we aren't just visiting these new places without impact. I hope that through visiting some of these recommended spots that we can engage more with the communities that we visit, and have a positive impact while on our adventures. Happy climbing!</p>

                <p>When you see the sites icon you can expect to find places and events that are significant or special to the area you are visiitng. Remember to try to be present and respectful when visiting these special places, they will certainly have a lot of meaning in their own community that is so much more than just the pictures we take home with us.</p>
